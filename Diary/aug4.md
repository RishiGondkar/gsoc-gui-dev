- So to optimise these variable we start with Gradient Descent method.

- The idea is to take one variable, for example, the attraction force, and the rest with a fixed value.  We then look for the value that minimizes the error.

- Error is calculate based on the difference between the reference path and the path that is travelled by the robot.

Task for tomorrow:
- [x] Developing an analytical tool to optimise the variables

- [ ] devise an optimizing strategy

- [ ] write down the steps in automating the workflow
