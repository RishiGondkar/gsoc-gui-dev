## July 23

- While analysing the data of the robot's pose, i observed one thing that the the angle of the robot varies from -1.57 to +4.71 in radian
  - To make it from -PI to +PI, a conversion is necessary which is required for the metric calculation.
- these functionality are implement inside the navData Reader.
