## July 20

- One of the problem that i faced during testing is that sometimes the when the finds a obstacle it doesn't stop and start moving away from the target
- it will continue moving  (doesn't stop)
- i m still doesn't know the reason,
- a possible seneario is that the forces variable is incorreclty specified which make it move in arbitary direction.

Task for tomorrow:
- [ ] test component on various corner cases
- [ ] implement navDataReader
