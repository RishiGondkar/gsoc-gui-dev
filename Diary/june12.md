I have gone through the fakeHumanAgent to get an idea how to insert a node in AGM

One of the difficulty that i face is all the test code for how to insert a node in AGM is in Cpp.

So figuring out how to do the same thing in python takes a lot of effort and time, 
many of the classes that are used in Cpp are not available in python. So mapping the functions
is a tricky part. 

Task for tomorrow:
- [ ] write a code to insert a node in DSR
- [x] updated the human interaction gui element
