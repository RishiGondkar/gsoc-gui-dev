* I have implement functionality to add the links in AGM

->  one of the problem that i faced during implementing this part was that the id that is supplied to 
AGMLink class is of type str
- this has came to my notice when I compare edge with int id with the AGMlink object, and it doesn't produce the expected result\


Task for tomorrow:
- [x] add the functionality to add links in AGM
- [ ] add remove functionality to remove link from AGM
