Added viewLaser functionality, for this, I have used Qpainter with concentric circles and rectangles 
as the scan points. 

Also added the camera viewer. This frame will show rgbd interface listening at port 10096.
For this also I have used the Qpainter with Qframe to display the image.

QpaintEvent is used to render the image as soon as the new data comes.


Task for tomorrow:
- [ ] write a code to insert a node in DSR
- [x] Added view Laser functionality.
- [x] Added view Camera functionality.
