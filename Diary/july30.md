## July 30

- As we need to automate the process of data capture,simultaneously move the robot to a particular position based on the optimization strategy used.
- several variable needs to be incremented or decremented based on the current observation

- So , to simplify the things we need to merge the the dataCapture and navigation component into one.

Task for tomorrow:
- [x] Addition in the previous component(dataCapture and NavDataReader)
- [ ] Developing an analytical tool to optimise the variables
