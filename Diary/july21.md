* functionality of nav data reader:
  - nav data reader is component which will fetch all the .dat files that are generated form the DataCapture component.

  - these can be added individually or in a group as a folder.

  -  after selecting the files it will show  the date in tabular form and all the metric value (based on which we compare different data) are displayed on the top.

  - a graph view can also be implemented to view the data more aesthetically. (will implement if time permits.)

Task for tomorrow:
- [x] test component on various corner cases
- [x] implement navDataReader
- [ ] implementing metrics
