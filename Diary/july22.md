- different metrics can be used to compare data.
- There are two types of metrics
 - **Subjective metrics**: These task-oriented metrics quantify the efficiency of the robot while performing the given task
 - **Objective metrics**: These metrics aim to reflect more intangible human factors, such as comfort.

 ---
- for now we will consider only Subjective metrics, and in that we use:
  - **Path length**: distance traveled from the start to the goal location.
  - **Path smoothness**: smoothness of a trajectory. ComÂ­puted as the sum of heading changes in subsequent steps along the path.

Task for tomorrow:
- [x] implementing metrics
