- how component works:
  1. the robot has a target position.
  2. the robot plans a path and navigates
  3. if the target is reached or the time exceeds the timeout occur, and the data is saved.

The component, through its interface, will be able to export the data for later analysis. This will be more or less the first version


Task for tomorrow:
- [X] implementing the component to capture navigation data
- [ ] prepare a video Demo
