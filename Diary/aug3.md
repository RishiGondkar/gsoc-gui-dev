## August 3

- Currently wwe focus only on the two highly dependent variables:
  - **internal forces**
  - **external forces**

-  The robot's sensors are not taken into account here. The path is formed by the intermediate nodes that attract each other (attraction forces). The repulsive forces take into account the robot's sensors (laser in this case). If objects are detected, they exert a repulsive force on the robot. The final trajectory is the sum of the attraction and repulsion forces.

Task for tomorrow:
- [x] Developing an analytical tool to optimise the variables

- [ ] devise an optimizing strategy
