## July 9


* on finally starting the component newSocialNavigationAgent 
i observed that there is no red points in the grid and the robot move through
the obstacle.

    * the solution to this problem is that the Robocomp
    is not compiled with FCL.\
    follow the link below to add the fcl support
    https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/development/doc/Compiling-RoboComp-with-collision-detection.md 
     




Task for tomorrow:
- [ ] understand the component
