Today i have implement the navigation part of the gui. one of the 
function is to move the omni robot, so maping keys to the motion of the robot.

w -> forward \
s -> backward \
a -> left \
d -> right \
f -> CClockwise \
g -> clockwise \
backspace -> stop

The second feature that is added is to move the robot 
to a particular coordinate. \
    so user can enter the position coordinate with heading and click goto button.


Task for tommorow:
- [ ] write a code to insert a node in DSR
- [x] implement the robot navigation part
- [x] integrate keyboardomnicontroller with our gui
